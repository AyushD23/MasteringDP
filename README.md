# Mastering Dynamic Programming: A Comprehensive Collection ðŸš€

## Overview

This repository is a dedicated learning resource and practical guide for mastering **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. It provides meticulously crafted C++ solutions to a wide range of classic DP problems, aiming to build a strong conceptual understanding and sharpen algorithmic problem-solving skills. Each solution is presented with a focus on clarity, efficiency, and a "humanized" code style, emphasizing the underlying patterns and thought processes.

## Why Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic Programming is a powerful algorithmic technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler, overlapping subproblems. It's fundamental to competitive programming, algorithm design, and various applications in computer science, economics, and operations research. This collection will help you:

* **Understand Core Concepts:** Grasp the principles of optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.
* **Master Techniques:** Learn to apply memoization (top-down DP) and tabulation (bottom-up DP) effectively.
* **Improve Problem-Solving:** Develop a systematic approach to identifying and solving DP problems.
* **Enhance Coding Skills:** Practice efficient C++ implementations with clean, readable code.

---

## Features

* **Extensive Problem Set:** A curated collection of essential DP problems covering various categories, from basic sequences to complex grid and string problems.
* **C++ Implementations:** All solutions are provided in C++, using `namespace std;`, concise variable names, and minimal, focused comments to highlight key logic.
* **Humanized Code Style:** Prioritizing readability and intuition, making it easier to follow the logic.
* **Clear Examples:** Each solution includes a `main` function with test cases to demonstrate functionality and expected outputs.

## Covered Problems (Partial List)

This repository includes solutions for, but is not limited to, the following classic Dynamic Programming problems:

* **Fibonacci Sequence:** (Tabulation)
* **Nth Catalan Number**
* **Coin Change:** (Minimum Coins, Number of Ways)

* **Word Break**
* **Decode Ways**
* **Jump Game (Can Reach End?)**
* **Jump Game II (Minimum Jumps)**
* **Maximum Subarray (Kadane's Algorithm)**
* **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock**
* **Maximum Product Subarray**
* **Counting Bits**
* **Perfect Squares (Min Squares to Sum N)**
* **Interleaving String**
* **Longest Common Substring**
* **Count Square Submatrices with All Ones**
* ... and many more to be added!

## Usage Guide

To run any of the C++ solutions:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Mastering-Dynamic-Programming.git](https://github.com/your-username/Mastering-Dynamic-Programming.git)
    cd Mastering-Dynamic-Programming
    ```
    (Replace `https://github.com/your-username/Mastering-Dynamic-Programming.git` with your actual repository URL.)

2.  **Navigate to a Problem Directory:**
    Choose a problem you want to explore, for example:
    ```bash
    cd problems/fibonacci/
    ```

3.  **Compile the C++ Code:**
    Use a C++ compiler (like g++) to compile the chosen file.
    ```bash
    g++ -o fib_tabulation tabulation.cpp
    ```
    (Replace `fib_tabulation` with your desired executable name and `tabulation.cpp` with the C++ file you want to compile.)

4.  **Run the Executable:**
    ```bash
    ./fib_tabulation
    ```
    Each `main` function in the `.cpp` files contains example test cases and their outputs.
