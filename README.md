## Why Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic Programming is a powerful algorithmic technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler, overlapping subproblems. It's fundamental to competitive programming, algorithm design, and various applications in computer science, economics, and operations research. This collection will help you:

* **Understand Core Concepts:** Grasp the principles of optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.
* **Master Techniques:** Learn to apply memoization (top-down DP) and tabulation (bottom-up DP) effectively.
* **Improve Problem-Solving:** Develop a systematic approach to identifying and solving DP problems.
* **Enhance Coding Skills:** Practice efficient C++ implementations with clean, readable code.

---

## Features

* **Extensive Problem Set:** A curated collection of essential DP problems covering various categories, from basic sequences to complex grid and string problems.
* **C++ Implementations:** All solutions are provided in C++, using `namespace std;`, concise variable names, and minimal, focused comments to highlight key logic.
* **Humanized Code Style:** Prioritizing readability and intuition, making it easier to follow the logic.
* **Clear Examples:** Each solution includes a `main` function with test cases to demonstrate functionality and expected outputs.

## Usage Guide

To run any of the C++ solutions:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Mastering-Dynamic-Programming.git](https://github.com/your-username/Mastering-Dynamic-Programming.git)
    cd Mastering-Dynamic-Programming
    ```
    (Replace `https://github.com/your-username/Mastering-Dynamic-Programming.git` with your actual repository URL.)

2.  **Navigate to a Problem Directory:**
    Choose a problem you want to explore, for example:
    ```bash
    cd problems/fibonacci/
    ```

3.  **Compile the C++ Code:**
    Use a C++ compiler (like g++) to compile the chosen file.
    ```bash
    g++ -o fib_tabulation tabulation.cpp
    ```
    (Replace `fib_tabulation` with your desired executable name and `tabulation.cpp` with the C++ file you want to compile.)

4.  **Run the Executable:**
    ```bash
    ./fib_tabulation
    ```
    Each `main` function in the `.cpp` files contains example test cases and their outputs.
